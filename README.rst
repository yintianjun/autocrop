autocrop
========

Perfect for batch work for ID cards or profile picture processing for your website, autocrop will
output images centered around the biggest face detected.

Use
---

From the command line:

::

    usage: [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-i INPUT] [-w WIDTH] [-H HEIGHT] [-v]

    Automatically crops faces from batches of pictures

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            Show this help message and exit
      -o, --output, -p, --path
                Folder where cropped images will be placed.
                Default: current working directory
      -i, --input
                Folder where images to crop are located.
                Default: current working directory
      -w, --width
                Width of cropped files in px. Default=500
      -H, --height
                Height of cropped files in px. Default=500
      -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit

-  Example: ``autocrop -i pics -o crop -w 400 -H 400``.

What it does
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The previous command will: 1. Copy all images found in the top level of ``pics`` to ``crop``, 2.
Crop around the face and resize to 400x400 pixels all images in ``crop``.

Images where a face can't be detected will be left in ``crop``. If no output folder is added, asks
for confirmation and destructively crops images in-place.

Installation
------------

Simple! In your command line, type:

.. code:: python

    pip install autocrop

Gotchas
~~~~~~~

Autocrop uses OpenCV to perform face detection, which is installed through binary
`wheels <http://pythonwheels.com/>`__. If you *already* have OpenCV 3+ installed, you may wish to
uninstall the additional OpenCV installation: ``pip uninstall opencv-python``.

conda
~~~~~

Development of a ``conda-forge`` package for the `Anaconda Python
distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__ is also currently slated for development.
Please leave feedback on `issue #7 <https://github.com/leblancfg/autocrop/issues/7>`__ if you are
insterested in helping out.

Installing directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases, you may wish the package directly, instead of through
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__:

::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/leblancfg/autocrop
    cd autocrop
    pip install .

Requirements
------------

Best practice for your projects is of course to `use virtual
environments <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`__. At the very least, you
will need to `have pip installed <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`__.

Autocrop is currently being tested on: \* Python: - 2.7 - 3.4 - 3.5 - 3.6 \* OS: - Linux - macOS -
Windows

Contributing
------------

Although autocrop is essentially a CLI wrapper around a single OpenCV function, it is actively
developed. It has active users throughout the world.

We have all the love in the world for extra contributors if you'd like to contribute to the
codebase. Please follow these steps: \* Fork the repository on GitHub. \* Install the extra dev
packages with ``pip install -r requirements-test.txt`` \* Make a branch off of master, commit and
test your changes to it.

Pull requests are tested on continuous integration (CI) servers before they are green-lit to merge
with the master branch. \* Run the tests with ``pytest``. \* Always run ``flake8 .`` before
submitting to check your coding style, as your CI will fail otherwise. \* Submit a Pull Request to
the master branch on GitHub.

If you have any questions regarding this, please reach me at leblancfg@gmail.com. We'll make sure we
get through the steps correctly.

If you'd like to have a development environment for autocrop, you should create a virtualenv and
then do ``pip install -e .`` from within the directory.
